## How to Run the Code

### Task 1: Code Completion
- Open `code_completion.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
- Compare AI-generated and manual implementations.
- Run the cells to see the sorting examples.

### Task 2: Automated Testing
```bash
python3 login_test.py
```
- Requires Google Chrome installed.
- Captures a screenshot (screenshot.png) after running tests.

### Task 3: Predictive Analytics
```bash
python3 predictive_analytics.py
```
- Requires Python packages: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn.
- Produces accuracy, F1-score, classification report, and confusion matrix (confusion_matrix.png).
